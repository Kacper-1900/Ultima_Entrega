# FutbolStars
This project is a basic football webpage that contains information about football teams through direct links to their official websites, as well as the option to purchase accessories and clothing from various teams through the FutbolEmotion store.

## Description
The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes basic features such as direct links to the official websites of the clubs featured on the page, a menu section where users can access the clothing store, accessories, and a news section. It also includes a support section where you can contact the company for help via email or phone call. Additionally, there is a section showing the location of the physical store, and at the end of the header, there is a direct link to the inspiration page. The website also includes decorative elements, such as photos in the lower corners. 

## Update !!
Hello everyone, there was a small update to my page, I installed a section where you can add your favorite football players, their jersey number, club and position, fo this I used javascript, html and css as always.

## BIG UPDATE !!
This time we got a big update for the web page. I added a function to EDIT and DELETE the players in the form, in case you add one by mistake or you simply want to delete the player, and the big thing is that I added a CONTACT FORM, that way you can contact our company via e-mail and we'll get in touch with you. This was made in JavaScript and a little bit of html, it took a lot of effort and stress I hope you like it and enjoy our last update, thank you !!!

## Installation and Usage
To run the page, a Visual Studio extension was used. By right-clicking on the .html file and selecting “Open with Live Server,” the page is launched in a web browser (Live Server).

## Big Acknowledgment
I really really want to thank my friend Saul for helping me with the local storage, because I had a big problem with it, also as it is the last update I want to thank everyone that helped me in this journey, my brother, Juan Pablo, Iván Brito, Aymar Navarro and Saúl Hernández. They gave me a massive help with JavaScript and CSS.
